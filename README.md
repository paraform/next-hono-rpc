# Evaluating Hono as a TRPC alternative in Nextjs app router

> **Warning**
> This stack is a work in progress, don't use it for production. You can follow the progress on Twitter [@wheretimewent](https://twitter.com/wheretimewent).

## Why?

We love the t3 stack but wanted to explore a lightweight alternate to trpc with a single package dependency and built in public facing api.

## Getting Started

**This is not a starter template.**

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
Run `docker compose up --build -d`
Run `bun db:push`
Run `bun i && bun dev`

## Roadmap

[x] Add drizzle orm
[x] Add hono api
[ ] Add auth example
[ ] Add ui
