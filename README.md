# Evaluating Hono as a TRPC alternative in Nextjs app router

## Why?

We love the t3 stack but wanted to explore a lightweight alternate to trpc with a single package dependency and built in public facing api.

## Getting Started

Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
Run `docker compose up --build -d`
Run `bun db:push`
Run `bun i && bun dev`

## Roadmap

[ ] Add auth example
[ ] Add ui
